# PythonETL
Demonstration of ETL using Python

Agenda: 

A. First indicate what type of ETL process this is handling.
B. Explain the source and the destination for easy upload
C. Indicate the destination can be a cloud-based DB or AWS. 
D. Once established, then create a UI that which allows both parties to establish which fields are being parsed in an easy UI system. 
E. Objects that which entail an easier UI system would allow the users to create boxes and reference the pairing process of each field in their raw files against what is available within the other system (aka DB system).
F. Create an automation script based off of this at which allows the end-users to easily set how often the process should run. 
G. Also create a one-time button that which allows the end-user to utilize instead of automation.
